wtdd_apogee2,SHIP,"The Apogee-class cruiser was already perfect, although striving for more firepower, this design was born. Not a science vessel anymore, but a military one, it doesn't contain civilian equipment nor cargo holds. Instead, pure symmetrical Apogee Mk. II has two pairs of large mounts and two hangar bays. It's a little bit cramped here, thus both fighter pilots and missile system officers usually don't perceive carriyng a duty with a joy.

It's quite uneasy to originate from where this design came from. There was a middle-ranked Tri-Tachyon officer wanting a promotion who propose the idea, but such ship was already spotted amongst pirates. Some qualified engineers made it possible to build the prototype that wasn't particularly broken, now all that's left is to spot a niche for such modification. It still has the same old flux coils, but at least ordnance problem was somewhat solved.",,,,
wtdd_apogee3,SHIP,"One of the fastest missile battleships of the post-domain world, this pirate designed, but solid, Apogee Mk. 3000 is able to hold its space against outer threats, providing significant firepower and suppression. Mostly based on the Apogee vessel, it manages to allocate some space for ""science and stuff"" as well, although someone sure was inspired by Pegasus instead. It's a rame gem from uncivilized worlds.",,,,
wtdd_cobra2,SHIP,"After finishing his second fat blunt, Dawg found the way to improve already devastating Cobra wing. It simply needs more auxilary thrusters. How come no one was bright enough to understand? Since it was impossible to furthermore upgrade bomber itself, he managed to squeesh two of them inside one hangar bay. Replacement rate has been changed accordingly through putting some pressure on working technicians.",,,,
wtdd_doomlin,SHIP,"Doomlin was created as a low-tech competitor against Tri-Tachyon monopoly. The look of it is pretty self-explanatory, as about five gremlins were built in together in order to make a cruiser class phase ship. Placing large weapon mounts inside phase coils was rather a bad idea, they tend to disable pretty often, and the whole ship seems like it's going to break apart any minute.",,,,
